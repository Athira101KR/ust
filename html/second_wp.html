      <p style="color: rgb(150, 38, 38);"> <span id="title">CSS</span>  is used to add styles on web pages that contain HTML elements. There are three methods to add styles on web pages, these are – Inline, Internal, and External. In this article, we will see the differences between Inline, Internal, and External CSS styles.</p>

        <p id="p1"><span id="title">  Inline CSS:</span> Inline CSS is a way of defining the styling of an HTML element by adding CSS rules directly to the element’s tag using the “style” attribute. It is used for quick and simple styling changes to specific elements, without creating a separate CSS file.</p>  
<p id="p2"><span id="title"> Internal CSS:</span> Internal CSS, also known as embedded CSS is a method of adding CSS rules directly to the head section of an HTML document. It involves using the  element to enclose the CSS code within the HTML document itself. Internal CSS is placed within the  section of the HTML document, typically after the document’s title and before any other content.</p>
<p class="p3"><span id="title">External CSS:</span>  External CSS is used to place CSS code in a separate file and link to the HTML document. To use external CSS, create a separate file with the .css file extension that contains your CSS rules. You can link this file to your HTML document using the “link” tag in the head section of your HTML document. </p>
